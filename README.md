# RJ45-BREAKOUT-8CH

Breakout board for 8x RJ45 connectors.

This board is mounted inside the automation cabinet to connect cables coming from up to eight 1-3 gang wall switch boxes, and routes those cables to an automation system.

The dimensions are such that the board can be mounted on a PCB DIN rail holder from the Brazilian manufacturer Metaltex, check [here](https://www.metaltex.com.br/produtos/componentes/suportes/sp7-suporte-para-montagem-de-placa-de-circuito-impresso-em-trilho-din) for details.
